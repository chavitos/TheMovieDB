# TheMovieDB
A MVP of The Movie Database API with a list and a detail screen.

# Build Instructions
  Before build the project on XCode, go to project folder and run, in terminal, "pod install" to install the cocoapods dependencies
  
# Third-part dependencies
  1 - Alamofire -> Used to API calls. I prefered use it instead URLSesion with data tasks because it has a protocol of url request that make easy the organization of API calls.
  2 - SDWEBImage -> To make easy the asyn download of images and management of cache.
